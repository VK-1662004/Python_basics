# <!-- #PYTHON 
# "Python was made by Guido Van Rossum in 1991 while watching monty python circus show ,he kept the name.
# Programming is the set of instruction given to the computer for doing some specific task.
# Python is the dynamically typed general purpose programming language whuch support both object oriented and fuctional programming langauage.
# Intrepreted and high level programming language."
# #IDENTATION 
# #MODULES AND PIP
# "Modules are the set of codes borrowed. 
# Modules are of two type built-in and external modules.
# Pip used for the external modules .
# #COMMENTS
# #used for one line comment.But for multiline we used multiline string by using double or single quotes."
# #PRINT
# print(1)
# print("HELLO")

# #Escape sequence character
# \n ,\t  ,\"..... \"
# #VARIABLES
# which holds value
# #DATATYPE
# Type of data which use to operate different type of data without causing error.
# 1. Numeric data: int, float, complex
# int: 3, -8, 0
# float: 7.349, -9.0, 0.0000001
# complex: 6 + 2i
# 2. Text data: str
# str: "Hello World!!!", "Python Programming"

# 3. Boolean data:
# Boolean data consists of values True or False.

# 4. Sequenced data: list, tuple
# list: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.

# Example:

# list1 = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]]
# print(list1)

# Output:

# [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ['apple', 'banana']]

# Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation.

# Example:

# tuple1 = (("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"))
# print(tuple1)

# Output:

# (('parrot', 'sparrow'), ('Lion', 'Tiger'))

# 5. Mapped data: dict
# dict: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.

# Example:

# dict1 = {"name":"Sakshi", "age":20, "canVote":True}
# print(dict1)

# Output:

# {'name': 'Sakshi', 'age': 20, 'canVote': True}

# type(a) -->

# <!-- #OPERATORS -->
# <!-- print(5+6)-addition
# print(15-6)-subtract
# print(15*6)-multiplication
# print(15/6)-division
# print(15//6)-floor division
# print(5%3)-gives remainder -modulus -->
# <!-- print(2**4) -->
# #TYPE CASTING
# implicit(convert by python itself from one level to another eg.int=1,float=2.3
#             int+flaot)
# explicit(convert by a developer a="1",b="2"
#           eg.int(a)+int(b))
# #INPUT
# a=int(input(a=))
